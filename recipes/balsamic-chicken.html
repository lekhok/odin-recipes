      <p>
        Elevate your dining experience with the Balsamic Grilled Chicken Salad.
        This vibrant creation marries the satisfying heartiness of grilled
        chicken with the refreshing embrace of a garden-fresh salad. The drama
        begins as succulent chicken breasts are bathed in a balsamic vinegar
        marinade, infusing them with a tangy depth of flavor. The grill sizzles
        as the marinated chicken cooks to juicy perfection, acquiring those
        enticing charred grill marks. As the chicken rests, a symphony of
        flavors comes together in the salad bowl. Crisp mixed salad greens
        provide the backdrop for a colorful canvas, adorned with halved cherry
        tomatoes that burst with sweetness, slices of cucumber offering a cool
        crunch, and slivers of red onion providing a hint of sharpness. The
        grilled chicken, sliced with precision, is the crowning glory. A
        sprinkling of crumbled feta cheese adds a creamy, tangy element, while
        chopped walnuts contribute a delightful nutty crunch. The final flourish
        comes in the form of a balsamic glaze, drizzled artfully over the salad,
        enhancing its beauty and flavor. Balsamic Grilled Chicken Salad invites
        you to savor a symphony of textures, tastes, and colors.

      <ul>
        <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1/4 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>6 cups mixed salad greens</li>
        <li>1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>1/2 cucumber, sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped walnuts</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a bowl, whisk together balsamic vinegar, olive oil, Dijon mustard,
          honey, salt, and black pepper to create the marinade.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag and pour in half
          of the marinade. Seal the bag and let the chicken marinate in the
          refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat the grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill the
          marinated chicken for about 6-7 minutes per side, or until cooked
          through.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes
          before slicing it.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large salad bowl, combine the mixed salad greens, cherry
          tomatoes, cucumber, and red onion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drizzle the remaining marinade over the salad and toss to coat the
          greens.
        </li>
        <li>
          Divide the salad among serving plates, top with sliced grilled
          chicken, crumbled feta cheese, and chopped walnuts.
