        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2-3 teaspoons loose black tea leaves or tea bags</li>
        <li>2-3 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed</li>
        <li>1 small cinnamon stick</li>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a saucepan, combine the milk and water and bring it to a gentle
          simmer over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the green cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, whole cloves, and sliced
          ginger to the milk-water mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue to simmer the mixture for about 5-7 minutes, allowing the
          spices to infuse their flavors into the liquid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the black tea leaves or tea bags to the simmering mixture. If
          using loose tea leaves, you can use a tea infuser or strain the tea
          later.

        <li>
          Let the tea simmer for an additional 3-5 minutes, depending on your

        <li>
          Once the tea is ready, strain it into cups to remove the tea leaves
          and whole spices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve the Masala Milk Tea hot and enjoy the soothing blend of milk and
